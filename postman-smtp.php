// ideas for future versions of the plugin
// -- query the SMTP server during the port test to determine capabilities
// -- use the queried capabilities for the wizard
// -- add WPMU functionality. ideas: allow network setup for network emails. allow network admin to choose whether subdomains may override with their own settings. subdomains may override with their own settings.
// -- add timeout setting for connectivity test
// -- if a test message succeeds, capture the domain of the primary mx, smtp server hostname and port, auth type, encryption type into a database (with the user's permission)
// -- write a plugin to capture the above information
// -- send mail in the background using ajax - the single mail thread can block the PHP server for quite some time
