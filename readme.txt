Kiss your Gmail problems good-bye with Postman, the first and only OAuth-enabled SMTP Plugin for WordPress. Never give out your password again!

== Description ==

Have you been having [trouble getting Gmail to send your email](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/smtp-connect-failed) recently? In 2014, Google began [increasing their SMTP security checks](http://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.ca/2014/04/new-security-measures-will-affect-older.html) to include OAuth 2.0, and [blocking traditional SMTP SSL/TLS](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6010255) mechanisms with Gmail.

If you don't care about security, you could ask Gmail to [allow less secure apps](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6010255) - but this workaround isn't available if you're using Google Apps to manage a domain.

Postman is a next-generation SMTP plugin which provides WordPress with a more secure mechanism for sending email. When your site generates an e-mail, for example from a Lost Password or a plugin like [Contact Form 7](https://wordpress.org/plugins/contact-form-7/), Postman handles the OAuth authentication and SMTP delivery.

###Features:
* Send mail to any host with SMTP/SMTPS(SSL/TLS/STARTTLS) like the other 171 WordPress SMTP plugins
* Send mail to Gmail with SMTPS using OAuth 2.0 - even if your Google password changes, your messages will still be sent!
* Easy to use Setup Wizard takes the guesswork out of configuring e-mail
* Built-in TCP Port Tester for troubleshooting connectivity issues due to firewalls

### Requirements:
* PHP 5.3.23 (with OpenSSL for SMTPS)
* an email account with any 3rd-party provider, and connectivity to their SMTP server
* a Gmail/Google Apps account, a Client ID from Google Developer and connectivity to the Gmail server (for SMTP with OAuth 2.0)

== Frequently Asked Questions == 

= Why should I use Postman to deliver my mail? =

If you're using Gmail, then Postman doesn't require your password to send email, only an *authentication token*. Other plugins ask for your Google password to send mail. **NEVER give out your Google password** to a 3rd-party or 3rd-party program that you don't fully trust.

= What is a Client ID? =
To use Postman, every website needs their own Client ID. The Client ID is used to control authentication and authorization and is tied to the specific URL of your website. If you manage several website, you will need a different Client ID for each one. Google has [instructions for creating a Client ID](https://developers.google.com/console/help/new/#generatingoauth2), which I've expanded upon below.

= How do I get a Google Client ID? =
1. Go to [Google Developer's Console](https://console.developers.google.com/) and choose Create Project, or use an existing project if you have one.
1. If you have previously created a project, select it from the Projects page and you will arrive at the Project Dashboard. If you have just created a project, you are brought to the Project Dashboard automatically.
1. If you have not filled out the consent screen for this project, do it now. In the left-hand hand navigation menu, select *Consent Screen* from under *APIs & auth*. Into *email address* put your Gmail address and in *product name* put the name of your WordPress site. Choose *Save*.
1. Select *Credentials* from under *APIs & auth*. Choose *Create a new Client ID*.
1. For the *Application Type* use "Web application". The first URL (*Authorized Javascript origins*) will be the root address of your WordPress site. The second URL (*Authorized Redirect URIs*) will be the the redirect URI shown on *Postman's Settings page*.
1. Choose *Create Client ID*.
1. Now you can enter the Client ID and Client Secret shown into Postman's settings page.

== Installation ==

Please be aware that if your host provides an internal SMTP server for you to use (e.g. GoDaddy), there is a good chance they have blocked access to Gmail's SMTP servers and Postman will not work for you.

1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
1. In the WordPress 'Settings' menu find 'Postman SMTP'.
1. In *Sender Email Address* enter your account's email address. This should be the same address you login to Google with.
1. Go to [Google Developer's Console](https://console.developers.google.com/) and create a Client ID for your WordPress site.. [instructions for this are detailed in the FAQ](https://wordpress.org/plugins/postman-smtp/faq/)
1. Copy your *Client ID* and *Client Secret* into the plugin's Settings page.
1. Choose the Save Changes button.
1. Choose the *Request Permission from Google* button and follow the instructions.
1. Send yourself a test e-mail. 

Postman is developed on OS X with PHP 5.5.14 and Apache 2.4.9. Postman is tested in a [Red Hat OpenShift](http://www.openshift.com/) environment.

* OpenShift production problem: This environment didn't like the callback and there were possibly invalid characters in the source script

= 0.1 - 2015-01-19 =
