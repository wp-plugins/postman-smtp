Kiss your email problems good-bye with Postman, the first and only OAuth-enabled SMTP Plugin for WordPress. Never give out your password again!

== Description ==

Have you been having [trouble sending your email](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/smtp-connect-failed) recently? In 2014, Google began [increasing their SMTP security checks](http://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.ca/2014/04/new-security-measures-will-affect-older.html) to include OAuth 2.0, and [blocking](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6010255) [traditional](http://googleappsdeveloper.blogspot.no/2014/10/updates-on-authentication-for-gmail.html) SMTP SSL/TLS mechanisms with Gmail.

Postman is a next-generation SMTP plugin which provides WordPress with the latest security mechanism for sending email. When your site generates an email, for example from a Lost Password or a plugin like [Contact Form 7](https://wordpress.org/plugins/contact-form-7/), Postman handles the OAuth authentication and SMTP delivery.

###* What's New for v1.3 *
*Now supporting OAuth 2.0 for Hotmail/Windows Live/Outlook.com!*

= Features =
* Send mail to any host with SMTP/SMTPS like the other 172 WordPress SMTP plugins
* Send mail to Gmail or Hotmail using OAuth 2.0. Your mail will be delivered even if your password changes.
* Integrated TCP Port Tester for troubleshooting connectivity issues due to firewalls
* Easy to use Setup Wizard takes the guesswork out of configuring email
* Supports international characters, HTML mail and MultiPart/MIME
* Supports Plain/Login/CRAM-MD5/OAuth2 authentication
* Supports SSL/TLS encryption

= Requirements =
* WordPress 3.9 (or later)
* PHP 5.3 (or later) with OpenSSL; or PHP 5.2 with SPL and OpenSSL 
* For generic SMTP: connectivity to an SMTP server that you have an account on
* For Gmail: a Gmail/Google Apps account, a Client ID from Google Developer and connectivity to the Gmail server
* For Hotmail/Windows Live/Outlook: an Outlook.com account, a Client ID from Microsoft Developer Center and connectivity to the Windows Live server

== Installation ==

> Please be aware that if your host provides an internal SMTP server for you to use (e.g. GoDaddy), there is a good chance they have blocked access to external SMTP servers and Postman will not work for you. Use the "Run a Port Test" feature to determine if your host has blocked access to the SMTP server you wish to use.

> Postman is developed on OS X with PHP 5.5.14 and Apache 2.4.9. Postman is tested in a [Red Hat OpenShift](http://www.openshift.com/) environment with PHP 5.3.3 and Apache 2.2.15.

== Frequently Asked Questions == 

= Why should I use Postman over the hundreds of other SMTP plugins? =

If you use other plugins to send Gmail or Hotmail, they're going to ask you for your Google or Hotmail password. And if you change your password, those same plugins will break. But Postman will continue to deliver your email without interruption.

> **NEVER give out your Google or Hotmail password** to a 3rd-party or 3rd-party program that you don't fully trust.

= Why do I need OAuth? Can't I just tell Google to allow less secure apps? =

Google does have a setting to [allow less secure apps](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6010255) but that's a band-aid, not a solution. And this option is not available if you're using Google Apps to manage a domain.

= What is a Client ID? =
To use OAuth, your website needs it's own Client ID. The Client ID is used to control authentication and authorization and is tied to the specific URL of your website. If you manage several website, you will need a different Client ID for each one.

= How do I get a Google Client ID? =
1. Go to [Google Developer's Console](https://console.developers.google.com/) and choose 'Create Project', or use an existing project if you have one.
1. If you have previously created a project, select it from the Projects page and you will arrive at the Project Dashboard. If you have just created a project, you are brought to the Project Dashboard automatically.
1. If you have not filled out the consent screen for this project, do it now. In the left-hand hand navigation menu, select 'Consent Screen' from under 'APIs & auth'. Into 'email address' put your Gmail address and in 'product name' put the name of your WordPress site. Choose 'Save'.
1. Select 'Credentials' from under 'APIs & auth'. Choose 'Create a new Client ID'.
1. For the 'Application Type' use 'Web application'. The first URL ('Authorized Javascript origins') will be the root address of your WordPress site. The second URL, 'Authorized Redirect URIs', will be the the redirect URI shown on Postman's Settings page.
1. Choose 'Create Client ID'.
1. Enter the Client ID and Client Secret displayed here into Postman's settings page.

= How do I get a Hotmail/Windows Live/Outlook.com Client ID? =
1. Go to [Microsoft account Developer Center](https://account.live.com/developers/applications/index) and select 'Create application'.
1. In the 'Application name' field enter the name of your WordPress site. Select 'I accept.'
1. Select 'API Settings' from under 'Settings'.
1. In 'Redirect URL', enter the redirect URI shown on Postman's Settings page. Select Save.
1. Select 'App Settings' from under 'Settings'.
1. Enter the Client ID and Client Secret displayed here into Postman's settings page.

= How can I stop all this OAuth nonsense!? =
If you have a Google Account, from the [Google Developer's Console](https://console.developers.google.com/) use the Delete button under the Client ID. If you have a Microsoft Live account, from the [Microsoft account Developer Center](https://account.live.com/developers/applications/index), select the Application and choose Delete Application.

== Troubleshooting ==

Here are some common error messages and what they mean. If you do not find your answer here, please [open a ticket](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/postman-smtp).

= Communication Error [334] =

This is the only OAuth2-specific error you will see. It tells you nothing about what's wrong, by design. There are a number of things to check:

* Make sure that your Sender Email Address is the same account that you use to create the Google Client ID or Microsoft Application.
* Maybe you sent an e-mail with the wrong Sender Email Address one too many times. Delete the Google Client ID or Microsoft Application, and start over.
* Maybe you sent an e-mail with a new user before logging in to the web. Login to the webmail, checks for errors, and try again.
* Maybe you refreshed the Client Secret but Postman still has the old one. Make sure your Client ID and Client Secret in Postman match the values shown in the Developer Console of your provider.
* If all else fails, delete your Google Client ID or Microsoft Application and start over

= Could not open socket =

* Your host may have installed a firewall between you and the server. Ask them to open the ports.
* Your may have tried to (incorrectly) use SSL over port 587. Check your encryption and port settings.

= Operation Timed out =

* Your host may have installed a firewall (DROP packets) between you and the server. Ask them to open the ports.
* Your may have tried to (incorrectly) use TLS over port 465. Check your encryption and port settings.

= Connection refused =

Your host has likely installed a firewall (REJECT packets) between you and the server. Ask them to open the ports.

= XOAUTH2 authentication mechanism not supported =

You may be on a Virtual Private Server that is [playing havoc with your communications](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/oh-bother-xoauth2-authentication-mechanism-not-supported?replies=9). Jump ship.

== Changelog ==

= 1.3 - 2015-02-09 =
* Sending Hotmail/Windows Live/Outlook.com email now supported with OAuth 2.0 authentication! If Wizard detects that a Hotmail server has been entered, it automatically configures OAuth 2.0.

= 0.2.5 - 2015-01-27 =
* Removed the namespace for users with older version of PHP
* Changed the Postman Redirect URI (now includes a trailing ?page=postman) - this means Client ID's from 0.2.4 or earlier MUST be updated with the new Redirect URI or re-created from scratch.

= 0.2.4 - 2015-01-25 =
* Fixed issues on servers where the plugin is installed as a symbolic link.
* Better error handling/debugging with php logging and assertions.

= 0.2.1 - 2015-01-23 =
